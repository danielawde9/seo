# Determining Searcher Intent: A Challenge for Search Marketers and Search Engines

### Navigational Queries

Users perform navigational searches with the intent of going directly to a specific website. In some cases, the user may not know the exact URL, and the search engine serves as the “White Pages.”

![](md-img/2021-03-16-17-48-19.png)

Opportunities: Pull searcher away from destination; get ancillary or investigatory traffic.

Informational Queries :  Very high when searches are for the publisher’s own brand. These types of searches tend to lead to very high conversion rates

### Informational Queries

Very high when searches are for the publisher’s own brand. These types of searches tend to lead to very high conversion rates Informational searches are primarily non-transaction-oriented (although they can include researching information about a product or service); the information itself is the goal, and no interaction beyond clicking and reading is required for the searcher’s query to be satisfied

![](md-img/2021-03-16-18-01-48.png)

Opportunities: Brand searchers with positive impressions of your site, information, company, and so on; attract inbound links; receive attention from journalists/researchers;
potentially convert to sign up or purchase.
Average traffic value: The searcher may not be ready to buy anything just yet, or may not even have a long-term intent to buy anything, so the value tends to be “medium” at best. However, many of these searchers will later enter in a more targeted search, and this represents an opportunity to capture mindshare with those potential customers. For example, informational queries that are focused on researching commercial products or services can have high value.


### Transactional Queries

ransactional searches don’t necessarily have to involve a credit card or immediate
financial transaction. Creating a Pinterest account, signing up for a free trial account at DomainTools, or finding the best local Japanese restaurant for dinner tonight are all transactional queries. Figure 1-4 shows an example of a transactional query.

![](md-img/2021-03-16-18-04-11.png)

Opportunities: Achieve transaction (financial or other).

Average traffic value: Very high.
esearch from Pennsylvania State University and the Queensland University of Technology shows that more than 80% of searches are informational in nature,  and only about 10% of searches are navigational or transactional

### Adaptive Search
ormally, a search on hotels would not include results for hotels in Rome, but when
the preceding query was for Rome, some results for hotels in Rome will be included. Keeping track of users’ previous search queries and taking them into account when determining which results to return for a new query—known as adaptive search—is intended to help the search engines get a better sense of a user’s intent. The search engines need to do this with care: excessive changes to the results they return based

### Searcher Intent

![](md-img/2021-03-16-19-27-57.png)

This type of analysis can help you determine where to place ads and where to concentrate content and links.

One problem in search is that when most searchers formulate their search queries,
their input is limited to just a handful of words (generally one to four). Because most people don’t have a keen understanding of how search engines work, they often provide queries that are too general or that are presented in a way that does not provide the search engine (or the marketer) with what it needs to determine, with 100% accuracy 100% of the time, their specific intent. Additionally, search engine users may not have a specific intent for an individual search query beyond “curiosity” about a general trending topic, or subject matter. While this poses potential difficulty in delivering relevant results, it also poses great opportunity to capture the mind of someone

These types of general queries are important to most businesses because they often get the brand and site on the searcher’s radar, and this initiates the process of building trust with the user. Over time, the user will move on to more specific searches that are more transactional or navigational in nature.


## Document Analysis and Semantic Connectivity

In document analysis, search engines look at whether they find the search terms in
important areas of the document—the title, the metadata, the heading tags, and the
body of the text. They also attempt to automatically measure the quality of the document based on document analysis, as well as many other factors.4

Reliance on document analysis alone is not enough for today’s search engines, so they also look at semantic connectivity. Semantic connectivity refers to words or phrases that are commonly associated with one another. For example, if you see the word aloha you associate it with Hawaii, not Florida. Search engines actively build their own thesaurus and dictionary to help them determine how certain terms and topics are related. By simply scanning their massive databases of content on the Web, they can use fuzzy set theory and certain equations to connect terms and start to understand web pages and sites more like a human does.

- Measuring which keyword phrases to target
- Measuring which keyword phrases to include on a page about a certain topic
- Measuring the relationships of text on other high-ranking sites and pages
- Finding pages that provide “relevant” themed links

### Content Quality and User Engagement

Search engines also attempt to measure the quality and uniqueness of a website’s content. One method they may use for doing this is evaluating the document itself. For example, if a web page has lots of spelling and grammatical errors, that can be taken as a sign that little editorial effort was put into that page.

### Interaction with web search results

Search engines also attempt to measure the quality and uniqueness of a website’s content. One method they may use for doing this is evaluating the document itself. For example, if a web page has lots of spelling and grammatical errors, that can be taken as a sign that little editorial effort was put into that page.5

### Google Analytics

Bounce rate
The percentage of visitors who visit only one page on your website

## Link Analysis

Link analysis goes much deeper than counting the number of links a web page or website has, as all links are not created equal (one link can be worth 10 million times more than another one). Links from a highly authoritative page on a highly authoritative site will count more than other links of lesser authority. A search engine can determine a website or page to be authoritative by combining an analysis of the linking patterns and semantic analysis.

The degree to which search engines rely on evaluating link neighborhoods is not clear, and links from irrelevant pages can still help the rankings of the target pages. Nonetheless, the basic idea remains that a link from a relevant page or site should be more valuable than a link from a nonrelevant page or site.
Another factor in determining the value of a link is the way the link is implemented and where it is placed. For example, the text used in the link itself (i.e., the actual text that will go to your web page when the user clicks on it) is also a strong signal to the search engines.

### Evaluating Social Media Signals

### What is semantic search?
The word "semantic" refers to the meaning or essence of something. Applied to search, "semantics" essentially relates to the study of words and their logic. Semantic search seeks to improve search accuracy by understanding a searcher’s intent through contextual meaning. Through concept matching, synonyms, and natural language algorithms, semantic search provides more interactive search results through transforming structured and unstructured data into an intuitive and responsive database. Semantic search brings about an enhanced understanding of searcher intent, the ability to extract answers, and delivers more personalized results. Google’s Knowledge Graph is a paradigm of proficiency in semantic search.

# Ranking
## Analyzing Ranking Factors

- Domain-level link authority features
- Page-level link metrics
- Page-level keywords and content
- Page-level keyword-agnostic features
- Domain-level brand metrics
- Usage and traffic/query data
- Page-level social metrics
- Domain-level keyword usage
- Domain-level keyword-agnostic features

Domain-level link authority features
Domain-level link authority is based on a cumulative link analysis of all the links to the domain. This includes factors such as the number of different domains linking to the site, the trust/authority of those domains, the rate at which new inbound links are added, the relevance of the linking domains, and more.

Page-level link metrics
This refers to the links as related to the specific page, such as the number of links, the relevance of the links, and the trust and authority of the links received by the page.

Page-level keywords and content
This describes the use of the keyword term/phrase in particular parts of the HTML
code on the page (<title> tag, <h1>, alt attributes, etc.).

Page-level features other than keywords
Factors included here are page elements such as the number of links on the page,
number of internal links, number of followed links, number of “nofollow” links,
and other similar factors.

Domain-level brand metrics
This factor includes search volume on the website’s brand name, mentions,
whether it has a presence in social media, and other brand-related metrics.

Page-level traffic/query data
Elements of this factor are click-through rate to the page in the search results,
bounce rate of visitors to the page, and other similar measurements.

Page-level social metrics
Social metrics considered include mentions, links, shares, likes, and other social
media site–based metrics. It should be emphasized that many SEO practitioners
believe that this is a ranking factor even though studies have since shown otherwise, and representatives from Google clearly state that social signals are not part of their algorithm.

Domain-level keyword usage
This refers to how keywords are used in the root or subdomain name, and how
impactful that might be on search engine rankings.

Domain-level keyword usage
This refers to how keywords are used in the root or subdomain name, and how
impactful that might be on search engine rankings.

## Negative Ranking Factors

Malware being hosted on the site
The search engines will act rapidly to penalize sites that contain viruses or Trojans.

Cloaking
Search engines want publishers to show the same content to the search engine as
is shown to users.

Pages on the sites with links for sale
Google has a strong policy against paid links, and sites that sell links may be
penalized.

Content that advertises paid links on the site
As an extension of the prior negative ranking factor, promoting the sale of paid
links may be a negative ranking factor.

Page speed
Back in 2010, Google’s Matt Cutts announced that Google was making page speed
a ranking factor. In general, it is believed that this is a negative factor for pages that are exceptionally slow.

## Google Search technique 

![](md-img/2021-03-19-17-10-53.png)

### Determining keyword difficulty

When you are building a web page, it can be useful to know how competitive the keyword is that you are going after, yet this information can be difficult to obtain. However, there are steps you can take to get some idea of how difficult it is to rank for a keyword. For example, the intitle: operator shows pages that are more focused on your search term than the pages returned without that operator (e.g., intitle:"dress boots”).
You can use different ratios to give you a sense of how competitive a keyword market is (higher results mean that it is more competitive). For example:
- dress boots (108,000,000) versus “dress boots” (2,020,000) versus intitle:"dress boots”(375,000)
- Ratio: 108,000/375 = 290:1
- Exact phrase ratio: 2,020/37 = 5.4:1

### Uncovering subscriber-only or deleted content

Uncovering subscriber-only or deleted conten
If no Cached link is available, use Google Translate to take your English document and

translate it from Spanish to English (this will reveal the content even though no
Cached link is available):

https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&sl=es&tl=en

### Identifying neighborhoods

The related: operator will look at the sites linking (the linking sites) to the specified site, and then see which other sites are commonly linked to by the linking sites. These are commonly referred to as neighborhoods, as there is clearly a strong relationship between
sites that share similar link graphs.


# SEO Planning: Customizing Your Strategy

- What the organization is trying to promote (service, product, content)
- Who the target market is (can be as simple as “women” or as detailed as personas)
- Brand (includes copy and messaging)
- Website structure (includes site architecture, navigational elements, and file/URL naming conventions)
- Current site content assets (includes images, videos, PDF files, white papers, case studies, articles)
- Ease with which the content and site structure can be modified (involves the CMS and web development teams)
- Editorial resources and calendar for content development (what content is developed, by whom, and on what timeline)
- Competitive landscape

## Business Factors That Impact Your SEO Strategy

Revenue and business models
The effective SEO strategy takes into account the purpose of the site—whether it
is to sell products, sell advertising, obtain leads, or gain membership signups. 

Target customers
Who are you trying to reach? This could be an age group, a gender group, or as
specific as people looking to buy a house within a specific neighborhood

Competitors
The competitive landscape is another big factor in your overall strategy. Competition may be strongly etrenched in one portion of the market online, and it may make sense to focus on a different segment

Branding goals
There may be search terms for which it is critical that you have top search exposure, for branding reasons.

Content development
An important part of SEO and general online success is the creation and optimization of high-quality content for your users. For most businesses, your capacity tocreate quality content on an ongoing basis can significantly improve your SEO efforts, both from a content-availability perspective (more content in the search engines) and from a user engagement and link development perspective (great content breeds great links and social sharing, both of which can positively influence SEO


How people search for products like yours
Understanding what customers do when they are searching for products or services like yours is one of the most basic functions of SEO

- The competitor discovers a unique, highly converting set of keywords.
- The competitor discovers a targeted, high-value link from an authoritative  ource.
- The competitor saturates a market segment, justifying your focus elsewhere.
- Weaknesses appear in the competitor’s strategy, which provide opportunities for exploitation.

## SWOT Analysis

![](md-img/2021-03-19-22-41-05.png)

- What sources of traffic are working well (converting on established site goals) for your site/business?
- Which projects/properties/partnerships are driving positive momentum toward traffic/revenue goals?
- Which of your content sections/types produces high traffic, conversions, and ROI?
- What changes have you made historically that produced significant value?

Determining the weaknesses can be tougher (and requires emotional separation from
the data):

- What content is currently driving low levels of search/visitor traffic?
- Which changes that were intended to produce positive results have shown little or no value?
- Which traffic sources are underperforming or underdelivering?
- What projects/properties/partnerships are being leveraged poorly, or not at all?

Parsing opportunities requires a combination of strength and weakness analysis. You want to find areas that are doing well but have room to expand, as well as those that have yet to be explored:

- What brainstormed but undeveloped or untested projects/ideas can have a significant, positive impact?
- What traffic sources currently sending good-quality traffic could be expanded to provide more value?
- What areas of weakness have direct paths to recovery?
- Which website changes have had positive results? Can these be applied more rigorously or to other areas for increased benefit?
- What new markets or new content areas are potentially viable or valuable for expansion?
- What sources of new content or new links have yet to be tapped?
- What third-party platforms (social media, content curators, etc.) can be utilized to expand reach and increase engagement?

Determining threats can be the most challenging of the tasks. You’ll need to combine

creative thinking with an honest assessment of your weaknesses and your competitors’ strengths, and consider the possibilities of macro-events that could shape your
website/company’s future:

- In your areas of weakness, which players in your market (or other, similar markets) are strong? How have they accomplished this?
- What shifts in human behavior, web usage, or market conditions could dramatically impact your business/site? (For example, consider the “what if people stopped searching and instead navigated the Web in different ways?” perspective. It is a bit “pie in the sky,” but we have already seen Craigslist make classifieds obsolete, and have witnessed Facebook start to take advertising market share from the search engines.)
- Which competitors have had the most success in your arena? How have they accomplished this? Where do they intersect with your business/customers?
- Are there any strategies implemented by startups in similar businesses that have had massive success in a particular arena that could be dangerous to your business if they were replicated in your market?

Conducting SWOT analysis from a web marketing and SEO perspective is certainly one
of the most valuable first steps you can take as an organization poised to expend
resources. If you haven’t taken the time to analyze the landscape from these bird’seye-view perspectives, you might end up like a great runner who’s simply gone off the course—sure, you’ll finish fast, but where will it take you?


## SMART Objectives

Specific objectives are important. It is easy to get caught up in the details of the plan and lose sight of the broader site objectives. You may think you want to rank #1 for this phrase or that, but in reality what you want is more granular than that: more leads, more page views, more customers. Perhaps you don’t even need more customers from organic search, but you want higher sales volumes, so in fact having the same number of orders but with a higher average order value would meet your objectives better.

Measurable objectives are essential if you are to manage the performance in meeting them—you can’t manage what you can’t measure. SEO practitioners have to help their clients or organizations come to grips with analytics, and not just the analytics software, but the actual processes of how to gather the data, how to sort it, and most importantly, how to use it to make informed decisions.

Achievable objectives are ones that can be accomplished with the available resources.
You could decide to put a man on Mars next year, for example, but it is just too big an undertaking to be feasible. You can be ambitious, but it is important to pick goals that can be met. You cannot possibly sell to more people than exist in your market. There are limits to markets, and at a certain point the only growth can come from opening new markets, or developing new products for the existing market.


Realistic objectives are about context and resources. It may be perfectly achievable to meet a certain objective, but only with greater resources than may be presently available. Even a top ranking on the most competitive terms around is achievable for a relevant product, but it is a realistic goal only if the resources required for such an effort are available.

Timelined objectives are the final part of the SMART methodology. If there is no timeline, no project can ever fail, because it can’t run out of time. SEO generally tends to take longer to implement and gather momentum than a paid search advertising campaign. It is important that you set milestones and deadlines so that you can manage expectations and course-correct.


EX: 

“We want to rank at #1 for loans” is not a SMART objective. It doesn’t identify the specific reason why the company thinks a #1 ranking will help it. It doesn’t have a timeline, so there is no way to fail. It doesn’t state an engine on which to be #1, s there’s a guaranteed argument if the intention is to rank well on both Google and Bing, but the result is only high rankings on Bing.
“We want to increase approved loan applications generated by organic search by 30%
over six months” is a far better objective. There is a deadline, and the company can certainly gauge progress toward the specific objective. The company can look at its current market share and the resources committed to see whether this is an achievable and realistic goal.

# SEO Implementation: First Stages

- Target keywords
- Cross-link relevant content (ex:“Frequently Bought Together” )
- Use anchor text, intuitively (instead click here in anchor, Use anchor text, intuitively)
- Use breadcrumb navigation
- Minimize link depth

### Single-Page Applications


Server rendering versus client-Only rendering.
If the website owner doesn’t care about achieving top ranking, and the only goal  is getting indexed—and, the only goal is to get indexed by Google, not any other search engine—then it is OK to do clientonly rendering with Angular. Google has gotten very good recently at indexing client rendered HTML. If you go down this route, you will need to do the following:

1. Enable push state in Angular so you get pretty URLs without the hash.
2. Implement UI Router or the new Component Router in Angular so you can map URLs to pages.
3. Follow all normal SEO best practices for page titles, URLs, content, etc. Nothing changes here.
4. Optimize the heck out of the initial page load—a major mistake many make is thinking initial page load time for client-rendered apps doesn’t matter, but it does!

While the above approach will work for Google indexing, you will perform better in
organic search with server rendering. The reasons for this are:

The options for server rendering are as follows:
- Implement in PHP or another language. This will work but requires that you duplicate all pages, which is generally not feasible unless you have a small/simple site.
- Use Prerender.io or a similar service. This works but can get expensive for larger ites, can be tricky to set up, and you need to be OK with long page cache times (i.e., server pages are one day old).
- Build a custom solution off the Jangular library. Although this works, it does require a lot of heavy lifting.



# Auditing an Existing Site to Identify SEO Problems

1. Check SEO FROG

2. Page load time
3. Mobile-friendliness
4. Usability
5. Accessibility/spiderability
6. Search engine health checks

- Perform a site:<yourdomain.com> search in the search engines to check how many of your pages appear to be in the index. Compare this to the number of unique pages you believe you have on your site. Also, check indexation numbers in your Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools accounts.
- Check the Google cache to make sure the cached versions of your pages look the same as the live versions.
- Check to ensure major search engine Search Console and Webmaster Tools accounts have been verified for the domain (and any subdomains, for mobile or other content areas). Google and Bing currently offer site owner validation to “peek” under the hood of how the engines view your site.
- Test a search on your brand terms to make sure you are ranking for them (if not, you may be suffering from a penalty; be sure to check your associated Search Console/Webmaster Tools accounts to see if there are any identifiable penalties,  r any other helpful information).

7. Keyword health checks

8. Duplicate content checks

The first thing you should do is make sure the non-www versions of your pages (i.e., http://yourdomain.com) 301-redirect to the www versions (i.e., http://www.yourdomain.com), or vice versa (this is often called the canonical redirect

You can also use search operators such as inurl: and intitle: (refer back to Table 2-1 for a refresher) to check for duplicate content. For example, if you have URLs for pages that have distinctive components to them

9. URL checks Make sure you have clean, short, descriptive URLs

10. HTML <title> tag review

Make sure the <title> tag on each page of the site is unique and descriptive. If you want to include your company brand name in the title, consider putting it at the end of the <title> tag, not at the beginning, as placing keywords at the front of a page title (generally referred to as prominence) brings ranking benefits. Also check to ensure the <title> tag is fewer than 70 characters long, or 512 pixels wide.

11. Content review

12. Meta tag review

13. Sitemaps file and robots.txt file verification

14. URL redirect checks
Use a server header checker such as Redirect Check or RedirectChecker.org

15.
